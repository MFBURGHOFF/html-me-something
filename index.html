                        <p>In 2002, Joanna had created two EPs, <i>Walnut Whales</i> and <i>Yarn and Glue</i>. These EPs were not intended for public distribution, but after playing them for friends on tour Joanna started to sell them at her early shows. Soon after, this led to her being signed by the record label, Drag City. Joanna Newsom released her first proper album, <i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i> in 2004 via Drag City. Joanna wrote and produced every song on the album except for "Three Little Babes," which is a traditional Appalachian folk song. The album garnered critical acclaim due to her poly-rhythmic harp playing and eccentric singing voice. It was clear early on that Joanna had a unique musical perspective.</p>

                        <h2><i>Ys</i>, 2006</h2>
                        <img src="images/Ys_cover.jpg"/>
                        <p>Joanna Newsom's second album, <i>Ys</i>, (pronounced ees), marked an ambitious new direction for the singer-songwriter. The album features orchestration arranged by Van Dyke Parks and production from Steve Albini. In addition to bringing in more collaborators, <i>Ys</i> is noteworthy for it's 55:38 runtime, which spans only 5 songs. The shortest song, "Cosmia" clocks in at 7:15, while the longest track, "Only Skin", is a 16:53 epic. In these songs, Joanna (abstractly) addresses personal topics such as the death of a best friend, the end of a romantic relationship, and a continuing illness. The album takes it's name from the city Ys, which according to myth, was built on the coast of Brittany and later swallowed by the ocean. Joanna has said when trying to land on a name for the album she had a dream where the letters "y" and "s" came to her. She later read about the mythical city in a book that was recommended by a close friend. </p>

                        <img src="images/Joanna_Newsom_-_Have_One_On_Me.jpg"/>
                        <p>For her 2010 album, <i>Have One on Me</i>, Joanna once again showcased her growth and maturity as a musician. <i>Have One on Me</i> is even more ambitious than the sprawling <i>Ys</i>. Joanna's third album is a triple album that clocks in at just over 2 hours long. The record is widely viewed as a break-up record, but also touches on themes such as death and motherhood. This record more than any of her previous efforts incorporated elements of genres like jazz and bluegrass. With this record Joanna once again proved that she wants to continue to pushing her sound in exciting and new directions. </p>

                        <img src="images/Joanna_Newsom_-_Divers.jpg"/>
                        <p><i>Divers</i> is the fourth studio album by Joanna Newsom. While the album is less ambitious in length and scope, the themes presented throughout are just as complex as her previous three releases. This album deals directly with death, loss of love, and time. While this album is more synth-heavy than her previous efforts, the usual instruments such as harp and piano are still prevalent.</p>
